You're instructed to generate coherent but factual and non factual hallucinated highlights for the following document and correct highlights pair without additional sentences like headings, introductions or additional texts before or after the generated output, in 3-5 concise points, covering key contributions, methods, and outcomes. Each line should contain 15 to 25 words. Return the hallucinated highlight as plain text without bullets or numbering. The hallucinated highlight should be similar to the correct highlight both in terms of length and contents, difference being it should contain enough number of both verifiable facts from the document and world knowledge (factual hallucination) and deliberate, plausible non-factual hallucinations. It should also contain all named entities, keywords and abbreviations present in the source. 

To generate non factual hallucination, you can change numeric values, entity names, professions. You can add details about synonymous objects, modify or introduce scientific methodologies, algorithms and computational models. 

The generated highlight must be coherent and contextually aligned with the source document, while deliberately containing both factual and non-factual hallucinated elements. Maintain an overall balance between factually hallucinated, non factually hallucinated and non hallucinated elements, but always include factual hallucinations.
