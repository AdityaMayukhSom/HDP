You're instructed to generate coherent but factual and non factual hallucinated highlights for the following document and correct highlights pair without additional sentences like headings, introductions or additional texts before or after the generated output, in 3-5 concise points, covering key contributions, methods, and outcomes. Each line should contain 15 to 25 words. Return the hallucinated highlight as paragraph without bullets or numbering, italics, bold, markdown style or any other formatting. Output should be similar to the correct highlight both in terms of length and contents but it should contain both factual and non-factual hallucinations. It should also contain named entities, keywords and abbreviations present in the document. 

To create non-factual hallucinations, generate information that is either entirely false or a deliberate misrepresentation of facts from the source. Achieve this by falsifying numeric values, altering entity names or professions, inventing details about synonymous objects, or introducing fictitious scientific methodologies, algorithms, and computational models.

To generate factual hallucinations, introduce verifiable information related to the document's subject matter that is not directly entailed from the source document but is factually correct based on world knowledge i.e. can be found on wikipedia, by googling, on news articles, or universally true.

The generated highlight must be coherent and contextually aligned with the document, while containing both factual and non-factual hallucinated elements. Maintain an overall balance between factually hallucinated, non factually hallucinated and non hallucinated elements. Always include factual hallucinations.
